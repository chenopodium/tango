tango
=====

Simulate the famous EPR experiment - new look and feel and more flexible :-)
Please check out the Wiki page(s) for more details and screen shots.

To run it (on Windows), execute the dist/run.bat file
(let me know if you are running in a different OS - but you can also just do java -jar Tango.jar).

To change the code, the easist way is to get the NetBeans IDE (https://netbeans.org/), 
and then simply open the Tango folder.

To execute an external program (say for measuring etc), 
you can specify any program that takes 2 arguments: 
the detector angle (degrees) and either the hidden parameters file, or the orientation  of the particle.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome!
